# Privacy Policy for EuroPay QR Converter

_Last updated: November 28, 2025_

EuroPay QR Converter (the "App") is a mobile utility that helps you read and convert European payment QR codes (Slovenian UPN and EPC/SEPA formats). This document explains how the App handles your data.

The App is published by the individual developer listed on the Google Play Store listing ("we", "us").

---

## 1. Data we process

The App processes the following types of data **on your device** when you use it:

- **Payment QR contents**: when you scan or import a QR code, the App reads the encoded text.
- **Payment details parsed from the QR**:
  - Recipient name
  - IBAN
  - Amount
  - Payment reference (structured/unstructured)
  - Optional BIC and purpose text

This data is used only to display and convert the payment, and to generate new QR codes for your own banking app.

We do **not** collect usernames, passwords, bank logins, or card numbers.

---

## 2. How data is processed

- All QR decoding and payment parsing happens **locally on your device**.
- We do **not** run our own backend service for the App.
- We do **not** transmit payment details (recipient, IBAN, amount, reference) from your device to our own servers.

If you choose to share a generated QR image or copy text into another app (for example, your banking app or a messaging app), the selected data will be handed off through the standard Android/iOS share mechanisms that you initiate.

---

## 3. Permissions

The App may request the following permissions depending on how you use it:

- **Camera** – used only to scan payment QR codes.
- **Photo / media access** – used only if you choose to import a QR code from your gallery.

You can decline these permissions. If you do, you can still enter payment details **manually** in the App.

We do not use these permissions to collect other media or to track you.

---

## 4. Advertising and third‑party services

The App uses **Google AdMob** to show ads.

AdMob may collect certain data, for example:

- Advertising identifiers
- Approximate location or device information
- Interaction data related to ads

This data collection is controlled by Google and is covered by Google&apos;s own privacy policies and the choices you make in Google settings and the consent dialog (where applicable).

We do **not** send payment data parsed from QR codes to AdMob for profiling or targeting, and we do **not** sell this data to third parties.

Other than AdMob and the platform providers (Google/Apple) that distribute the App, we do not integrate additional third‑party analytics SDKs.

---

## 5. Data retention

- Payment data is held in memory only while you use the App and is discarded when you close the App or reset the form.
- We do not store payment data on our own servers.
- If your device or another app (for example, your banking app) stores data after you share or copy it there, that storage is governed by that app&apos;s own privacy policy.

---

## 6. Children

The App is intended for general use by adults who manage their own bank payments. It is **not** designed for children and does not knowingly target or collect personal data from children.

---

## 7. Your choices and rights

- You can revoke camera and photo permissions at any time in your device settings.
- You can uninstall the App at any time, which removes the App and its local data from your device.
- You can manage ad personalization and related data directly in your Google account and device settings.

Because we do not operate a backend and do not maintain user accounts for this App, we do not hold server‑side copies of your payment data that could be edited or deleted by us.

---

## 8. Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will adjust the "Last updated" date at the top of this document. Material changes may also be reflected in the App description on the store listing.

## 9. Contact

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or how the App handles data, please use the contact details provided in the Google Play Store listing (developer email).
